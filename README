**Install**

Copy arc-ardour.colors in ~/.config/ardour8/themes/

Copy Ardour-*splash.png in ~/.config/ardour8/resources/

Select "arc" in Settings > Colors > Color scheme and restart ardour.
Switching back to a different theme will require restarting ardour (this is due to how color aliases are handled in this theme).

Recommended appearance settings:

- flat and square buttons
- no shade on regions
- no space under regions
- if "use colors to show midi note velocity" in not set, make sure to give MIDI tracks a bright and saturated color to make MIDI editing comfortable.
